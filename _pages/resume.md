## Personal Goals
I'm looking for opportunities to accelerate my abilities in web application development in the Pittsburgh area. I want the opportunity to learn from peers in a fast-paced environment that values employee education. I need a workplace where my co-workers challenge my abilities and give me a target to strive towards.

Although Pittsburgh is my home, I'm open to opportunities in the following cities:

- New York City, NY
- Portland, OR
- Seattle, WA
- Los Angeles, CA

I'm also interested in opportunities working abroad for a period of up to a year.
