My goal is to build software that uses data to make life a little more efficient. 

I'm passionate about applying data to decision making, and customer-centric, acquisition-oriented analysis. My work has been featured by [Google](http://analytics.blogspot.com/2013/10/mind-gap-improving-referral-information.html) and even [presented on by the CTO of GiftCards.com](http://www.pghtech.org/events/i-love-it-when-you-call-me-big-data/tech-talk-hitachi-data-systems-stage.aspx). 

I'm also a big cycling fan; I recently biked from my house in Pittsburgh to Niagara Falls.
